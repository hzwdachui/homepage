EXPERIENCE
=====
- **Intern: Shannon.AI**                                                   06/2019 - 09/2019  
https://ifluent-chinese.shannonai.com/ (expired)
	- Implemented backend service for a grammar check application by Python Flask; Designed tables for user and query; Used wrk to do load testing and assigned the most efficient CPU and GPU resource. Deployed the application by Docker and Kubernetes.
	- Contributed to a [300 stars project](https://github.com/ShannonAI/service-streamer). Modified the part of Redis as a  message queue and the part of test.
	- Modified the strategy of sending input batches to NLP model; Separated the backend service process and the model prediction process for robust deploying. Used JIT to accelerate prediction of model.


PROJECTS
====== 
- [**Researcher Community Website**](http://49.234.89.22/)                              01/2020
	- Built an online research platform as one of the founders. Designed the product and developed the website.
	- Implemented backend service by Python Flask; Used MySQL as the database, including resume uploading, position and seminar posting; Deployed the application by Docker. 
	- Designed the style of the product; Used Jinja2 engine for frontend. 
- [**Hair Segmentation, Matting and Application**](https://github.com/hzwdachui/cs231n_project) 03/2019 - 06/2019                            
  - Tested the performance of different backbones, then applicated DeepLabv3+ network for hair segmentation.
  - Performed experiments including hyperparameter tuning, preprocessing and integrating LFW dataset, applicating CRF post processing and alpha matting. Performed error analysis.  
  - Built a webcam demo to perform real-time hair segmentation and coloring on personal computer.
- **Object-Oriented Systems Design Project: Game Editor** 02/2019 - 03/2019
  - Worked in a five-member-team to implement an editor for a graphical adventure game where users can design shapes and reactions with particular interaction.
  - Defined Shapes, Pages and Actions class to be used to implement editor in the project; Implemented actions of dragging, clicking shapes in the game. Saved editing data for game and actions for undo.
