Currently I'm a MS student at Stanford University and expected to be conferred in June 2020. Though I'm in the department of Materials Science and Engineering, I was impressed by the atmosphere of 
coding here and erolled CS106B in the first quarter as many students did. After several weeks of getting into the course content, I found myself loving this field. As a 
result, I decided to be a software developer in the future. The first year was a hard year, I began with basic data structure and algorithms, and then step by step, database 
and web application. I was also surprised to find myself able to participate in a computer vision project in CS231n. The period of seeking an opportunity as a SDE was hard for me. Thanks to Shannon.ai, a young and cool company, giving me an unforgettable experience as a backend engineer.  
I'm passionate in taking efforts to make me more professional in coding.  

Also, I am looking for fulltime SDE positions in 2020.
