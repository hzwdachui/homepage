EXPERIENCE
=====
- **Intern: Shannon.AI**                                                   06/2019 - 09/2019
	- Implemented backend service for a grammar check application by Python Flask; Designed tables for user and query; Used wrk to do load testing and assigned the most efficient CPU and GPU resource. Deployed the application by Docker and Kubernetes.
	- Contributed to a [300 stars project](https://github.com/ShannonAI/service-streamer). Modified the part of Redis as a  message queue and the part of test.
	- Modified the strategy of sending input batches to NLP model; Separated the backend service process and the model prediction process for robust deploying. Used JIT to accelerate prediction of model.


PROJECTS
====== 
- **Hair Segmentation, Matting and Application**                            03/2019 - 06/2019
  - Tested the performance of different backbones, then applicated DeepLabv3+ network for hair segmentation.
  - Performed experiments including hyperparameter tuning, preprocessing and integrating LFW dataset, applicating CRF post processing and alpha matting. Performed error analysis.  
  - Built a webcam demo to perform real-time hair segmentation and coloring on personal computer.
- **Object-Oriented Systems Design Project: Game Editor** 02/2019 - 03/2019
  - Worked in a five-member-team to implement an editor for a graphical adventure game where users can design shapes and reactions with particular interaction.
  - Defined Shapes, Pages and Actions class to be used to implement editor in the project; Implemented actions of dragging, clicking shapes in the game. Saved editing data for game and actions for undo.
 
- **Web Application Project: Photo Share App**										 03/2019
  - Implemented backend server by Node.js and frontend by AngularJS. 
  - Features the app supports: create/delete account, login/logout, upload/delete photos, like/dislike photos, comment on photos, show latest moment of each user, show most commented and lasted photo of each user.  
- **Data management and data system project**                                     12/2018
  - Analyzed the relationship of public education dataset and demonstrated it by Entity Relationship Modeling diagram. Visualized quantitative relationships between features.
  - Trained and evaluated a binary logistic regression model with selected features, then predicted the development level of a country/region with educational statistics.
